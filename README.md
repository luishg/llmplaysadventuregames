# llmplaysadventuregames
This project automates playing the classic point-and-click adventure game like "Maniac Mansion" or "Monkey Island" on  Linux using computer vision and AI. The script captures screenshots of the game window, sends them to a Large Language Model (LLM) for analysis, and executes the AI-suggested clicks to interact with the game.
